#  Winning Poker Strategy for Play in Raked Games in Costa Rica

There are a number of different things to take into account when playing poker in a raked game, whether it is in Costa Rica or any other country. Here are some winning poker strategy tips for play in raked games:

*Start with conservative plays - In order to minimize the amount of money you could lose due to the rake, start by making conservative plays. This means playing tight and folding when you are not sure about your hand.

*Consider the rake - When calculating your chances of winning a hand, take into account the rake that will be taken from the pot. In some cases, it may be worth folding even if you have a good hand if the rake is high enough.

*Focus on big pots - In general, it is better to concentrate on playing for big pots rather than trying to win lots of small pots. This will help you to minimize the effect of the rake on your profits.

*Play fewer hands - Another way to reduce the impact of the rake is to play fewer hands overall. This will allow you more time to make considered decisions and give you a better chance of winning those big pots.
