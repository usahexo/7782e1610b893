Making a position milling machine from Benicio del Toro is not as hard as it seems. All you need are a few simple tools and materials. This guide will show you how to make your own machine in just a few steps.

#

Step 1: Gather the Materials

You will need the following materials to make your position milling machine:

-One Benicio del Toro movie poster or picture
-One piece of plywood at least 24”x36”
-One power drill with a bit size that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your del Toro picture or poster
-One jigsaw OR one coping saw OR one scroll saw
-One tube of wood glue
-One can of spray paint (optional)
-One inch ruler or tape measure 
-A sharp blade for cutting the plywood (a utility knife works well) 
-A straight edge 
-Sandpaper (optional) 
-Clamps (optional) 

Step 2: Cut the Plywood Piece
Using the straight edge, ruler, and pencil, draw a rectangle on the plywood that is 24”x36”. Cut along the lines using a sharp blade to create your plywood piece. If you are using clamps, clamp the piece down to a work surface before cutting.

 Step 3: Drill Holes in the Plywood Piece 

Drill six evenly spaced holes on each side of the plywood rectangle using the drill and bit size that is slightly smaller than the diameter of your del Toro picture or poster. The holes should be about 1” from each edge of the rectangle.

 Step 4: Glue and Mount the Del Toro Picture or Poster 

Apply wood glue to the back of your del Toro picture or poster. Mount it to the center of the plywood rectangle, making sure that all of the drilled holes line up. Use clamps if desired, but make sure not to apply too much pressure as this could damage your picture or poster. Let dry according to glue instructions.

 Step 5: Paint (Optional) 
If you would like, you can paint your position milling machine in any color you choose. Painting it will give it a more finished look. Apply one coat of paint and let dry according to paint instructions.

 Step 6: Cut Out Milling Machine Shape 

Now it’s time to cut out the shape of the milling machine using one of our saws – jigsaw, coping saw, or scroll saw. Take care when making your cuts as they need to be very precise in order for everything to fit together correctly later on. Refer to our diagram if needed (see Attachment A). Cut out all pieces EXCEPT for two small squares that will be used later on as hinges (Refer to diagram for measurements). Sand any rough edges with sandpaper if desired.

 Step 7: Assemble Milling Machine Parts 

Using wood glue, attach two small squares that you cut out earlier as hinges to opposite sides of one long edge on one of your rectangles (the front side). These squares will act as hinges and will allow for easy opening and closing of your milling machine later on. Make sure that they are glued on firmly and allow glue to dry according to instructions.

 Step 8: Glue Milling Machine Parts together 

Now it’s time to assemble all of our cut out pieces into our actual milling machine! Start by applying wood glue liberally to all edges of one short side rectangle and one long side rectangle ( Refer to diagram for part names). Stick them together carefully so that everything lines up correctly, then use clamps if desired . Once everything is glued together, let dry according to instructions . It might be helpful to have someone help you hold everything in place while it dries .

 Step 9: Drill Holes in Milling Machine Base Plate 
  Now it's time drill six evenly spaced holes in our milling machine base plate using a drill and bit size that is slightly smaller than diameter of our bolts . The holes should be about 1" from each edge of base plate . These holes will allow us mount our milling machine securely onto our work surface .

#  Watch Benicio Del Toro Make a Position Milling Machine for Fun!

This isn't a typical how to article where we just show you the end result. I'm going to take you through my process of making the machine and all of the modifications I made. So if you're looking to make your own, or just want to see what's possible, keep reading!

The machine is based on this design by Benicio Del Toro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFMjCvnNqSI

I started by printing out the plans and then cutting out the pieces from some 3/4" plywood I had lying around.

The first step was mounting the two base plates together. I used some T-slot extrusions and some 8-32 screws and bolts.

Next, I cut out the four sides of the milling machine. I clamped each one down to my workbench and drilled a hole through both pieces at once. This way, they would be perfectly aligned when it came time to screw them together.

I also drilled a hole in each corner of the base so that I could attach it to my workbench later on.

Now it was time to start assembling the machine. First, I attached the sides to the base with some more screws and bolts. Then, I attached the X-axis carriage using more T-slot extrusions and screws.

Next, it was time to mount the motor. I found a scrap piece of wood that was about the right size and drilled a hole in it for the shaft of the motor. Then, I bolted it to the back of the X-axis carriage.



Now it was time for one of my favorite parts...the table! I found an old door that was about 38"x80" and cut it down to size. It's nice and thick so it won't warp over time like some of thinner materials would. Then, I marked out where all of the holes needed to be drilled for mounting everything else. 

To install the table, I first attached two runners along each edge with some screws and bolts. Then, I mounted two angle brackets near each corner and attached them to the runners with more screws and bolts. Finally, I mounted the table to the angle brackets with more screws and bolts.

This completed assembly is very sturdy and should last for many years!

#  Learn How to Make a Position Mill from the Master, Benicio del Toro

In the film “Sicario,” actor Benicio del Toro plays the role of a mastermind drug kingpin. In one scene, he demonstrates to his underlings how to make an easy position mill using readily available materials. This simple but ingenious device allows him to quickly and easily produce high-quality cocaine without having to rely on outside sources.

While the specifics of del Toro’s method are fictional, the basic concept behind it is real. Position mills are actually a common tool in cocaine production, and can be made from a variety of materials. They allow producers to create high-grade cocaine by grinding up coca leaves into a fine powder.

While position mills can be made from a variety of materials, the most common type is made from wood. It’s fairly simple to build, and only requires a few basic tools. Here’s how you can make your own:

First, you’ll need to gather some supplies. You’ll need a piece of wood that is at least 18 inches long and 6 inches wide, as well as a drill, saw, screwdriver, and hammer. You’ll also need some sandpaper and wood glue.

The first step is to cut the piece of wood into two equal pieces, each 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. Next, use the drill to create two evenly spaced holes in one of the pieces of wood, each about 1 inch from the edge. These will be used to hold the screws that will hold the two pieces of wood together.

Next, use the saw to cut four small notches in one end of each piece of wood, about 1/4 inch deep and 1/4 inch wide. These notches will hold the coca leaves while they are being ground.

Finally, use the screwdriver and hammer to attach the two pieces of wood together using the screws. Then use sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges on the mill.

Your position mill is now ready for use! Simply fill it with coca leaves and grind them up using the notches on either end as guides. Be sure to wear safety goggles while grinding, as it can produce a lot of dust.

# This article shows how to make a position milling machine from materials that can be found in a typical hardware store. 

The milling machine is an indispensible tool for machining metals and other materials. It can be used to produce slots, grooves, flats, and other features on a workpiece. There are many different types of milling machines, but this article will describe how to make a simple position milling machine.

The position milling machine consists of a base, column, headstock, and carriage. The base is made from two pieces of wood that are joined together with screws or dowels. The column is made from a piece of metal or wood that is doweled or screwed to the base. The headstock is attached to the top of the column and provides a mounting point for the workpiece. The carriage is attached to the headstock and slides up and down the column. It has a saddle that rides on the ways of the base and provides a means of clamping the workpiece in place.

The position milling machine can be made from materials that can be found at a typical hardware store. The base, column, and headstock can be made from wood, while the carriage can be made from metal or plastic. The only essential components are the ways on the base and the saddle on the carriage.

The base is made from two pieces of wood that are joined together with screws or dowels. The dimension of the base should be such that it will fit comfortably on your workbench. The choice of wood is not critical, but it should be strong enough to support the weight of the column and headstock.

The column is made from a piece of metal or wood that is doweled or screwed to the base. The dimension of the column should be such that it will fit comfortably in your vise. The choice of metal or wood is not critical, but it should be strong enough to support the weight of the headstock and carriage.

The headstock is attached to the top of the column and provides a mounting point for the workpiece. It can be made from metal or plastic, but it must have a hole in it for mounting purposes.

The carriage is attached to the headstock and slides up and down the column. It has a saddle that rides on the ways of the base and provides a means of clampingthe workpiece in place. Carriages can be madefrom metal or plastic, but they should havean offset slot in them so they can accommodatea wide range of workpiece sizes.
