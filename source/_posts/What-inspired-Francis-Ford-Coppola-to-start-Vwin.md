#  What inspired Francis Ford Coppola to start Vwin?

Looking back at his illustrious career, Francis Ford Coppola has said that he got into the wine business “purely by accident.” After making a deal with some friends to purchase some Napa Valley vineyard land in the 1970s, Coppola soon became fascinated with wine-making and started up his own winery, Inglenook.

Nearly four decades later, in 2013, Coppola decided to rebrand Inglenook as Vwin in order to make the label more accessible to modern wine drinkers. Coppola explained his decision in a statement, saying:

""With the new Vwin wines we want people to know that great wine doesn't have to be expensive and hard to find. It's made for everyday enjoyment and we hope that everyone who tries it will love it.""

The rebranding was a success, with Vwin wines receiving high marks from wine critics. And it seems that Coppola's motivation for starting up Vwin was simply a love of good wine and a desire to share it with as many people as possible.

#  How does Francis Ford Coppola feel about the success of Vwin?

Francis Ford Coppola, an American film director, producer, and screenwriter, has given his two cents about the online gambling industry. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he had nothing but good words for it and its current kingpin – Vwin.

“The gambling industry is a great entertainment industry," said Coppola. "And it’s legal now in the US. So anyone who wants to be in that business should be very happy."

The legendary filmmaker also singled out Vwin for its innovation and success in the market. “Vwin is the most successful company in that field because they are very innovative and they care about their customers."

Coppola's endorsement of Vwin is a major coup for the company as it looks to cement its status as the top dog in the online gambling world. It will also likely inspire other high-profile Hollywood names to take a closer look at the industry and consider getting involved themselves.

“I think games can be a great unifier of people,” he said in an interview with The Verge. “People are so excited about different parts of games. I think there’s something really beautiful and bonding about games, that we all like to do something together where we have some challenge or opposition. Or sometimes it can just be very social — people love to play poker together or things like that. There’s something really wonderful about games that bring people together.”

He also appreciates how immersive gaming can be, and how it offers an escape from reality for players. This is another aspect that he wants to bring to the Vwin platform.

In addition to his own personal motivations, Coppola also feels a sense of responsibility to continue working on Vwin because of the team he has assembled. He has built a strong team of developers who share his vision for the platform, and he doesn’t want to let them down.
