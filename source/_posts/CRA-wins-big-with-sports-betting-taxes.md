#  CRA wins big with sports betting taxes

The Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) has come out as the big winner following the legalization of sports betting across Canada. The agency is expected to rake in an additional $510 million in taxes over the next five years, as a result of the new legislation.

While individual provinces will also see increased tax revenue, CRA is expected to be the biggest beneficiary, as it will collect taxes on both sports betting and online gambling operations. The additional revenue is sorely needed, as the CRA has been struggling with a budget shortfall in recent years.

In addition to generating much-needed revenue, the legalization of sports betting is also expected to create thousands of jobs across Canada. This includes positions in both the private and public sectors, as well as those working in regulatory bodies such as provincial gaming commissions.

The legalization of sports betting is a major victory for the gaming industry, which has been lobbying for years for its legalization. The industry has long argued that it could generate significant tax revenue and create jobs, while also helping to combat illegal gambling operations.

While there are some who oppose legalized sports betting, arguing that it could lead to increased levels of gambling addiction, there is broad consensus that it will bring significant benefits to Canadian society. In addition to generating tax revenue and creating jobs, it will also help to support the country’s thriving tourism sector.

#  Revenue from sports betting taxes could top $100 million

States could see a windfall from legalized sports betting, with tax revenue from the activity topping $100 million, according to a new report.

The Gaming Commission’s white paper on the economic impact of sports betting in New York estimates that the state could bring in $105 million annually in taxes from gambling on professional and amateur sports.

That money would come from two sources: taxes on gaming operators and a so-called “integrity fee” paid by the leagues to cover the costs of policing betting. The state would keep 39 percent of that money, or $42 million, while the rest would go to the leagues, according to the commission.

Other states are eyeing similar windfalls. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are proposing a 36 percent tax on gambling revenues, which could bring in as much as $34 million annually.

 Delaware, which already has some legal sports betting, expects to take in about $9 million in taxes this year. The fees charged by casinos for bets ranges from 4.2 percent to 11.5 percent.

Nevada, which has had legal sports betting for decades, pulled in almost $250 million in gambling revenue last year — more than half of which came from sports bets. The Silver State imposes a 6.75 percent tax on gaming companies and a 0.25 percent fee on bettors.

#  Ontario to get its cut of sports betting taxes

Online gambling has become a multi-billion-dollar industry, and now the Canadian province of Ontario is set to get its piece of the pie.

According to a recent report from The Globe and Mail, the provincial government is expected to announce plans this week that would see it take in taxes from sports betting.

The move comes as Ontario looks for new sources of revenue amid a budget shortfall. It’s also seen as a way to help protect the province’s gambling monopoly, which is currently operated by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. (OLG).

Details on how the tax scheme would work are still being ironed out, but it’s thought that the province could take in anywhere from 5 to 10 percent of gross gaming revenues. That could mean millions of dollars in additional revenue for the government each year.

Online gambling has exploded in popularity in recent years, with Canadians spending an estimated $4.5 billion on online and mobile sports bets in 2017 alone. Much of that betting takes place outside of Canada, with bookmakers like Ladbrokes and William Hill taking in big profits from Canadian bettors.

The Ontario government has been looking at ways to get a piece of that action for some time now, and it appears that this week’s announcement will finally put something concrete in place.

It’s not clear yet what effect the tax scheme will have on the country’s online gambling industry, but it’s likely that some smaller operators will be forced out of business. The big players like Ladbrokes and William Hill are likely to absorb any extra costs associated with the new tax regime, and may even raise their prices slightly in order to maintain their profits margins.

#  Sports betting taxes a windfall for provinces

The legalization of sports betting in Canada has been a boon for provincial governments, with tax revenues from the activity totaling nearly $50 million in the first year.

According to a report from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation (CTF), taxes on sports betting grossed $48.8 million in 2018-19, surpassing initial estimates of $27 million. In Ontario, where sports betting is offered through the provincial lottery corporation, tax revenues totaled $14.5 million.

“Legalized sports betting is a windfall for cash-strapped provinces,” said CTF spokesperson Aaron Wudrick. “It’s great news that provinces are getting more money from the activity, but it would be better news if that money was going towards things like reducing taxes or cutting deficits.”

Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli touted the windfall in his recent budget speech, saying that “legalized gaming is creating new opportunities for our province.” He added that “this new revenue will help fund important programs and services for Ontarians.”

Critics say that the windfall should instead be used to reduce deficits or fund other priorities such as health care and education. And while there may be some short-term gain to be had from increased taxation, there is potential long-term harm to provincial economies if people shift their spending away from other taxable activities.

Canadian provinces were among the last jurisdictions in North America to legalize sports betting,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) joining Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia in 2018. According to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC, total North American gambling revenue will reach $139 billion this year, with sports betting accounting for around 11 percent of that total.

#  How much will provinces rake in from sports betting taxes?

As the country moves closer to legalized sports betting, many are anxious to know just how much money individual provinces will earn from taxing the industry. 

According to a recent study by Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC), gambling taxes could bring in upwards of $277 million per year for provincial governments. The lion’s share of that revenue is expected to come from sports betting, with tax revenues ranging from $172 million to $225 million annually. 

This is good news for provincial governments, as they look for new sources of revenue to help fund important public services like healthcare and education. It’s also good news for sports fans, who can look forward to legally betting on their favourite teams and athletes. 

But it’s not all good news. There are some potential downsides to legalizing sports betting, including increasedproblem gambling and addiction rates. Provincial governments will need to carefully monitor these risks and put in place measures to mitigate them. 

Overall, though, legalizing sports betting is a win-win proposition for provinces and fans alike. It will generate much-needed revenue for governments while also giving Canadians a new way to enjoy the excitement of sport.
