#  Which state doesn't have legalized gambling?

There is no definitive answer to this question as gambling is legal in different forms in a number of U.S. states. Some states, such as Nevada and New Jersey, have legalized most types of gambling, while other states have more limited laws allowing for only particular forms of gambling. There are a few states, however, that do not have any legalized gambling whatsoever. These include Hawaii, Utah, and South Dakota.

#  Why isn't this state legalizing gambling?

It's baffling that some states haven't legalized gambling, especially when it comes to lotteries. West Virginia is one such state; their citizens have to cross state lines into Ohio or Pennsylvania in order to gamble on lottery games. There are many pros to legalizing gambling, chief among them being the influx of revenue it would bring into the state.

There are a number of reasons why a state might choose not to legalize gambling, though most of them seem to be antiquated and no longer hold any sway. The first reason is moral grounds; some people believe that gambling is immoral and that it will lead to more crime and poverty. However, as more and more states legalize gambling, this argument becomes less and less persuasive.

Another argument against gambling is that it will ruin the local economy. This claim is also unsupported; in fact, many studies have shown that legalizing gambling actually boosts the local economy. It creates jobs and brings in revenue from out-of-state players.

Some opponents of gambling argue that it's a regressive tax, meaning that it hurts the poor more than the rich. However, taxing gambling would help offset some of the costs associated with addiction and crime. And unlike other regressive taxes, such as sales tax, people who gamble can afford to pay more for their pleasure.

So why hasn't West Virginia legalized gambling? It's unclear, but Hopefully they'll come around soon!

#  What are the consequences of not legalizing gambling?
