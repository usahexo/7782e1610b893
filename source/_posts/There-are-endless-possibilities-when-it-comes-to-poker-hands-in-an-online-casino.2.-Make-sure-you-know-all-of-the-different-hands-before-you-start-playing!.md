Below are some of the most common straight poker hands:

1) The three-of-a-kind hand: This hand is made up of three cards of the same rank, plus two other cards. For example, if you have three queens in your hand, plus two other cards, you would have a three-of-a-kind hand.

2) The four-of-a-kind hand: This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank, plus one other card. For example, if you have four aces in your hand, plus one other card, you would have a four-of-a-kind hand.

3) The full house hand: This hand is made up of three cards of the same rank, and two cards of another rank. For example, if you have three kings in your hand, and two other cards, you would have a full house hand.

4) The flush hand: This hand is made up of five cards all from the same suit. For example, if you had five clubs in your hand, you would have a flush hand.

5) The straight hand: This is a five card poker hand that ranks higher than a flush but lower than a three-of-a-kind. A straight is composed of five consecutive cards that are not all from the same suit (e.g., 4♠ 5♥ 6♦ 7♥ 8♣).
