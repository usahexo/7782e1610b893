#  Online Gambling Sites Finally Get Green Light in the US

After years of campaigning by the gambling industry, the US Supreme Court has finally ruled that individual states can legalize online gambling. This is a major victory for gambling companies such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, which have been pushing for this ruling for some time.

The decision overturns a 2006 law which banned online gambling, but it will still be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it. There are already a few states that have announced their intention to do so, including New Jersey and West Virginia.

This decision is likely to be met with mixed reactions from US citizens. While some may welcome the opportunity to gamble online, others may be concerned about the potential for addiction and other negative consequences.

Legalizing online gambling will also bring with it a number of regulatory challenges. States will need to decide how best to protect consumers and ensure that gambling sites are fair and honest. This is something that many countries have struggled with in the past, and it will be interesting to see how the US fares in this regard.

#  Nevada Becomes First State to Fully Regulate Internet Casinos 

On June 12th, the Nevada Gaming Commission unanimously agreed to regulate internet casinos in the state, making it the first in the nation to do so. The new regulations will go into effect on July 1st, and will require all internet casinos wishing to operate in Nevada to obtain a license from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Nevada Gaming Commission has been discussing online gambling regulation since early this year, and initially planned to only allow casinos with a brick-and-mortar presence in the state to offer online gambling services. However, after hearing testimony from several online casino operators, the Commission voted 4-1 to approve regulations that will allow any company that holds a license for traditional gaming in Nevada to offer online gambling as well.

Commissioner Tony Alamo Jr. was the only vote against the new regulations, saying that they didn't go far enough to protect consumers. "I'm not convinced that we've done enough here," he said. "I don't want our citizens taken advantage of."

Under the new regulations, internet casinos will be required to verify the age and location of their customers, and will not be allowed to accept players from other states. They will also be required to maintain records of all wagers placed by customers for at least five years.

Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval praised the Commission's decision, calling it an important step forward for the state's economy. "This is good news for Nevada's economy and provides another avenue of economic opportunity for our businesses," he said. "The ability to offer legal and reputable online poker adds another dimension to our industry while protecting Nevadans."


Internet casinos have been operating in a legal gray area for many years, but have recently come under increased scrutiny from state and federal authorities. In April 2011, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to Congress stating that the Department of Justice would not prosecute operators of legal online casinos who followed state law. However, last December Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which prohibits banks and financial institutions from processing transactions related to illegal online gambling activities. This has made it difficult for many internet casino operators to operate in the U.S., as most banks are unwilling to risk violating federal law by processing transactions for them.

Despite this uncertainty, many states have been considering legalizing online gambling in order to generate additional revenue. Delaware became the first state to legalize online gambling earlier this year, and New Jersey is expected to follow suit soon.

#  Delaware and New Jersey Join Nevada in Legalizing Online Gambling 

Governors John Carney of Delaware and Phil Murphy of New Jersey have both signed bills into law legalizing and regulating online gambling within their respective states. This makes Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada the only US states currently permitting online gambling.

The new laws will allow residents in each state to bet on casino games, poker, and other gambling activities through websites and mobile apps. The regulations stipulate that players must be physically located in Delaware, New Jersey, or Nevada in order to participate.

The bills were passed in response to the growing popularity of online gambling, as well as the desire of state governments to generate new revenue streams. In Delaware, for example, the new law is expected to generate $7 million in annual tax revenue.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other problems, but supporters say that such concerns can be addressed through regulation. They also contend that online gambling is a safe and convenient way to enjoy gaming activities.

#  Pennsylvania Looks Likely to Legalize Online Gambling This Year 

State lawmakers in Pennsylvania are moving closer towards legalizing online gambling, with the House of Representatives passing a bill that would allow both casinos and racetracks to offer such games as poker and blackjack to residents within the state.

The 156-39 vote in favor of the bill was seen as a major step forward for its proponents, who have been trying to legalize online gambling in the state for several years now. The bill will now move on to the Senate, where it is hoped that it will be passed and signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf.

If everything goes according to plan, Pennsylvania could soon join Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware as one of the few states in America to offer legalized online gambling. This would be a major coup for the state’s casino operators, who are currently seeing their business decline due to increasing competition from casinos in other states.

It’s not yet clear how much money the state could stand to make from legalized online gambling, but analysts believe that it could be in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars each year. This would be a welcome development for a state that is facing significant budget problems.

Online gambling is already quite popular in America, with an estimated $4.7 billion being wagered each year. However, this is done illegally and without any consumer protections in place. By legalizing and regulating online gambling, Pennsylvania would be ensuring that players are protected while also generating much-needed revenue for the state.

#  More and More Countries Opening Up to Legalized Internet Gambling

The number of countries that have opened up to legalized internet gambling continues to grow. A recent study by industry analysts at H2 Gambling Capital shows that the number of countries with regulated online gambling has now risen to 28.

This is in stark contrast to the findings of the same study just two years ago, which showed that there were only 18 countries with a legal online gambling market. The dramatic increase can be attributed to a number of factors, including a growing acceptance of online gambling, new technologies that have made it easier to regulate and monitor gambling activity, and an increase in the number of operators willing to offer their services in new jurisdictions.

One country that has seen a particularly large growth in its regulated internet gambling market is Sweden. According to the latest figures from H2 Gambling Capital, Swedes wagered more than 10 billion Swedish kronor (just over $1 billion) on licensed online casinos in 2017, up from just 6.5 billion kronor ($752 million) in 2016. This makes Sweden the fourth largest regulated market for online gambling in the world, behind only the United States, China, and Japan.

Other countries that have seen large expansions in their regulated internet gambling markets include Portugal (where wagers grew from 1.5 billion euros [$1.7 billion] in 2016 to 2.3 billion euros [$2.6 billion]in 2017), Ireland (where wagers grew from 662 million euros [$751 million] in 2016 to 948 million euros [$1.1 billion] in 2017), and Denmark (where wagers grew from 2.8 billion Danish kroner [$431 million] in 2016 to 3.9 billion Danish kroner [$596 million]in 2017).

While many countries are opening up their regulated internet gambling markets, there are still a number of jurisdictions that remain closed or are slowly moving towards legalization. These include France, Italy, Spain, and South Korea, all of which have sizable online gambling markets worth billions of dollars each year. It is likely that these countries will eventually legalize online gambling as well, as public opinion continues to shift in favor of it and new technologies make it easier for regulators to ensure compliance with gaming laws.
