#  Father of victim outraged at casino's lack of security

The father of a 24-year-old man who was fatally shot in a casino parking garage is outraged at the lack of security at the facility.

"My son was killed in a place where there was no security," said the victim's father, who asked to remain unnamed. "It's just tragic that he was killed in a place like that."

The victim's father said his son was meeting friends at the casino for dinner when he was killed. He believes his son may have been targeted because he was carrying a large amount of cash on him.

"There needs to be more security at these places," said the victim's father. "This could have been prevented if there had been someone there to stop the shooter."

Casino officials say they are reviewing their security procedures in light of the shooting.

#  High Striker Game leads to another death

According to the police report, a 37-year-old male was playing the high striker game at an arcade in Richmond, VA on Saturday evening when he became angered after not being able to ring the bell. The man then began to punch the game machine, which caused it to tip over and hit him in the head. He was taken to a local hospital where he later died from his injuries.

This is not the first time that a death has been linked to this type of arcade game. In December 2017, a 36-year-old woman died after she was struck by a falling game machine in an Illinois arcade. And in May 2016, a 49-year-old man was killed by a falling game machine at an arcade in Italy.

While it is still unclear exactly how these machines are tipping over and injuring people, police are urging arcade operators to take extra safety precautions when placing these games in their establishments.

While it is still too early to say what specific changes will be made, the casino CEO’s statement is a sign that the industry is taking the issue of safety seriously. It is hoped that these measures will help to reassure casino guests and make them feel safer when visiting these properties.
