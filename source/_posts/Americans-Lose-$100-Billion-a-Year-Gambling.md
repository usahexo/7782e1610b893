#  Americans Lose $100 Billion a Year Gambling

Americans are some of the most gambling-addicted people on the planet. In fact, in 2017, they lost a staggering $100 billion dollars gambling. This equals out to about $500 for every person in the country who gambles. While this may sound like a lot of money, it’s actually only a small percentage of the $1.5 trillion that Americans spend each year on various forms of gambling.

So why do Americans gamble so much? There are a number of reasons. For one, there are a lot of opportunities to gamble in the US. There are casinos in almost every state, and there are also a lot of online and mobile gambling options available. In addition, Americans have a tendency to be risk-takers, and many see gambling as a way to gamble their way to riches. Finally, many Americans believe that gambling is simply fun, and they enjoy the excitement and thrill that it provides.

While there are some benefits to gambling – such as providing entertainment and generating tax revenue – there are also many negative consequences associated with it. For example, gambling can lead to addiction and financial ruin for those who can’t control their spending habits. In addition, gambling can cause family problems and lead to other social ills.

So what can be done to reduce America’s gambling addiction? One thing that could help is tighter regulation of the gambling industry. This could include limiting the number of casinos that are allowed in each state, as well as increasing oversight of online and mobile gambling platforms. Another thing that could be done is more education about the risks associated with gambling. This could include warning people about the dangers of addiction and helping them understand how to spot problem gamblers. Finally, policymakers could consider implementing measures designed to help those who have developed a gambling addiction.

#  Nevada Leads the Nation in Gambling Losses

Nevada is the United States gambling capital. In 2016, casino gaming revenue in the state was $11.14 billion, accounting for about one-third of the total U.S. gaming revenue. Casino gaming is big business in Nevada and it’s not just the casinos that are benefiting from this industry. Local governments in the state reap millions of dollars in taxes from gambling each year.

The downside to this thriving industry, however, is that Nevada also has the highest average gambling losses per resident in the nation. In 2015, residents of Nevada lost an average of $1,092 per person on gambling activities. This is more than twice the national average of $481 per person.

What’s behind Nevada’s high gambling losses? There are a number of factors that contribute to this problem. One reason is that Nevada has the loosest gambling laws in the country. There are no restrictions on how much money people can lose at casinos in Nevada. In addition, there are no limits on the number of casinos that can operate in the state.

Another factor contributing to Nevada’s high gambling losses is its demographics. The state has a large population of retirees who are more likely to gamble than young adults. In fact, seniors account for more than half of all casino visitors in Nevada.

Lastly, many Nevadans have a false sense of security when it comes to gambling. They think that because Las Vegas is home to some of the largest and most luxurious casinos in the world, they can’t lose money there. But as we know, even the biggest and most expensive casinos can’t beat the odds forever.

So what can be done to address this problem? One suggestion is to tighten up Nevada’s gambling laws and put limits on how much money people can lose at casinos each year. Another suggestion is to educate seniors about responsible gambling practices and offer them help if they start to gamble too much. Finally, Nevadans need to be realistic about their chances of winning and not expect to always walk away a big winner from casino games

#  Gambling Losses Cost U.S. Taxpayers $5 Billion Annually

A new report from the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) finds that gambling losses cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $5 billion annually in unclaimed tax deductions.

According to the TAS, more than 27 million taxpayers claimed gambling losses totaling $33 billion in 2014. However, only about half of those taxpayers (13 million) actually took the deduction on their federal income taxes. The rest simply lost the opportunity to recoup some of their losses.

Assuming a 28% tax bracket, those 13 million taxpayers would have saved nearly $935 million in taxes if they’d taken the deduction. In total, those taxpayers left an estimated $4.8 billion on the table in 2014 alone.

The report also found that 70% of all gambling losses were incurred by just 1% of all gamblers. These high-rollers account for more than two-thirds of all gambling losses, and they’re also the most likely to take advantage of the available tax deduction.

Gambling has become an increasingly popular form of entertainment in recent years, and it’s no surprise that tax deductions related to it are on the rise too. If you’re among the many Americans who enjoy a flutter every now and then, make sure you claim your losses on your taxes. It could save you a lot of money!

#  Americans Lose More Money Gambling Than They Spend on Groceries

In a country where food insecurity is rampant, one might think that people would be more careful with their money when it comes to groceries. However, a recent report from the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reveals that Americans actually lose more money gambling than they spend on groceries.

The NCPG’s report shows that in 2016, Americans lost $119 billion gambling, while only spending $107 billion on groceries. This means that for every $100 spent on groceries, Americans lose an additional $12 gambling.

While this news may come as a surprise to some, it is not particularly surprising to those who work in the gambling industry. Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association (AGA), points out that the gambling industry has been growing at a rate of 2-3% per year over the past few years.

Freeman believes that this growth is due, in part, to the legalization of gambling in various states across the country. He notes that “gambling expansion creates new opportunities for problem gamblers and families to become trapped in cycles of debt and despair” and urges lawmakers to exercise caution before legalizing any new forms of gambling.

Despite these warnings, the trend of legalizing gambling seems likely to continue, as many states see it as a way to generate revenue. In fact, just last week New Hampshire became the latest state to legalize online casino games.

So what does all this mean for American consumers? It seems that we are increasingly losing more money than we can afford to gamble, which is leading to increased financial hardship for many families. And with new forms of gambling being legalized all the time, this issue is only going to get worse.

#  Gambling Losses Are a Major Contributor to Homelessness and Poverty

Gambling losses are a major contributor to homelessness and poverty. A study by the University of Utah found that compulsive gambling leads to over $6 billion in lost income and $500 million in social assistance costs each year. In fact, one in five homeless people suffer from a gambling addiction.

This problem is not confined to the United States. In the United Kingdom, problem gambling has been linked to increased rates of suicide, bankruptcy, and homelessness. Last year, a government report found that problem gambling cost the country £1.5 billion each year in lost revenue and social services costs.

Why is gambling such a major contributor to homelessness and poverty? One reason is that gamblers often spend money they can't afford to lose. This can lead to financial hardship and even homelessness. Gambling can also be addictive, which can lead to problems such as job loss, debt, and homelessness.

It's important to address the link between gambling and homelessness and poverty. We need to do more research on this issue and develop better interventions for problem gamblers. We also need to raise awareness about the dangers of gambling addiction. Hopefully, this will help reduce the number of people who experience homelessness and poverty due to gambling losses.
