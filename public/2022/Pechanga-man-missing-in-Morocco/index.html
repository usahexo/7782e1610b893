The avid outdoorsman, who was known to go on long hikes alone, was last seen leaving his hotel in Ouarzazate on May 10th.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been no confirmed sightings of Michael and no ransom demands or other communication from any possible kidnappers. His family has set up a website and social media pages in hopes of getting any information about his whereabouts.</p>
<p>“We are just really struggling right now,” said Michael’s wife Kathy. “My kids are really missing their dad - he’s not just a dad but a best friend too.”</p>
<p>Michael is described as White, 5’11”, 185 lbs., with brown hair and green eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a blue shirt. If you have any information about his whereabouts, please contact the Moroccan authorities or his family at <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#102;&#x69;&#110;&#100;&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x63;&#104;&#97;&#x65;&#108;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#102;&#x69;&#110;&#100;&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x63;&#104;&#97;&#x65;&#108;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Local-man-disappears-while-on-vacation-in-Morocco"><a href="#Local-man-disappears-while-on-vacation-in-Morocco" class="headerlink" title="Local man disappears while on vacation in Morocco"></a>Local man disappears while on vacation in Morocco</h1><p>A local man from a small town in upstate New York has been reported missing while on vacation in Morocco. The man, who has not been identified, was last seen on September 5th, 2018.</p>
<p>Family and friends of the missing man say that he had been excited to take the trip, and they are at a loss as to what could have happened to him. Moroccan authorities are said to be investigating the case, but so far there have been no leads as to the man’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a tourist has gone missing in Morocco; in fact, several people disappear every year in the North African country. Some are later found dead, while others are never heard from again.</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons why someone might go missing in Morocco. Those traveling alone or unfamiliar with the country may become lost or find themselves in dangerous situations. Additionally, some people may be targeted by criminals or kidnappers looking for ransom money.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the man’s disappearance, his family and friends are hoping for a safe return. They have set up a Facebook page called “Find Brad In Morocco” to help spread the word and gather information about his whereabouts.</p>

<p>The man, who has not been identified, was on a trip to the North African country with his wife when he disappeared. His wife said that the last time she saw him was on October 10th, when he went out for a walk by himself.</p>
<p>She said that she became worried after he failed to return and contacted local authorities. A search of the area turned up no sign of him, and officials have since ruled out the possibility that he left the country illegally.</p>
<p>Friends and family of the man say they are baffled by his disappearance and have appealed for information about his whereabouts. They say that he was not prone to taking risks and would not have knowingly put himself in danger.</p>
<p>“He loved life and wasn’t one to take unnecessary risks,” said one friend. “This is completely out of character for him.”</p>
<p>If you have any information about this man or his whereabouts, please contact authorities immediately.</p>

Her family reported her missing on Jan. 10 after she failed to return home or call them. Lydia was last seen on Jan. 7 leaving the Pechanga Casino in Temecula with an unidentified man.</p>
<p>Lydia is described as a white female, 5’4” tall, weighing 120 pounds. She has blond hair and green eyes. Lydia was last seen wearing a white blouse, black slacks and black shoes. She also had a black purse with her. Lydia is known to enjoy gambling and may have gone to North Africa to gamble there.</p>
<p>The FBI is asking for the public’s help in finding Lydia Bartone. If you have any information about her whereabouts, please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).</p>
