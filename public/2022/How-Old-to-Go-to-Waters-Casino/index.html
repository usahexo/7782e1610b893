            <h1 id="How-Old-to-Go-to-Waters-Casino"><a href="#How-Old-to-Go-to-Waters-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Old to Go to Waters Casino?"></a>How Old to Go to Waters Casino?</h1><p>The Waters Casino is a casino located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The casino is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It features slot machines, table games, and a race and sports book.</p>
<p>The minimum age to enter the casino is 21 years old.</p>
<h1 id="Age-Restriction-Levied-at-Waters-Casino"><a href="#Age-Restriction-Levied-at-Waters-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Age Restriction Levied at Waters Casino"></a>Age Restriction Levied at Waters Casino</h1><p>The Waters Casino has announced that it will be implementing a new age restriction policy. The casino will now only admit guests who are 21 years of age or older.</p>
<p>This policy change comes in the wake of increased scrutiny of casinos by state regulators. One issue that has been highlighted is the fact that casinos can be a target for underage gambling.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Waters Casino said that the new age restriction policy is “an important step in our ongoing efforts to operate responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”</p>
<p>The Waters Casino is one of several casinos in Pennsylvania that have announced plans to raise the minimum age for admission. Parx Casino, Sands Bethlehem, and Hollywood Casino all announced plans to raise the minimum age to 21 earlier this year.</p>
<p>These changes come as Pennsylvania prepares to implement a new statewide gaming law. The law, which was signed by Governor Tom Wolf in October, will allow for up to 10 mini-casinos to be built in the state.</p>
<h1 id="Waters-Casino-in-compliance-with-Pennsylvania-Gaming-law"><a href="#Waters-Casino-in-compliance-with-Pennsylvania-Gaming-law" class="headerlink" title="Waters Casino in compliance with Pennsylvania Gaming law"></a>Waters Casino in compliance with Pennsylvania Gaming law</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board recently released a report stating that the Waters Casino is in compliance with state law. The casino, which is owned and operated by Harsco Corporation, opened earlier this year and has been in full compliance with all regulations since its opening.</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to have the Gaming Control Board’s approval and confirmation that our casino is in full compliance with all regulations,” said Harsco CEO Scott Sidwell. “We continue to work closely with the Board and regulators as we build out our world-class gaming and entertainment destination.”</p>
<p>The Waters Casino is located in the town of Harmarville, about 20 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh. The casino features over 1,000 slot machines and 24 table games, as well as a variety of dining and entertainment options.</p>
<p>The Waters Casino is one of several casinos that have opened in Pennsylvania in recent years. The state has seen a boom in casino gambling, thanks in part to its liberalized laws and partnership with Hollywood Casino Corp.</p>
<h1 id="Waters-Casino-only-letting-those-18-and-older-inside"><a href="#Waters-Casino-only-letting-those-18-and-older-inside" class="headerlink" title="Waters Casino only letting those 18 and older inside"></a>Waters Casino only letting those 18 and older inside</h1><p>Recently, the Waters Casino has come under scrutiny as it was announced that only those 18 and older would be allowed inside the casino. Many are criticizing the casino for what they believe is a discriminatory policy. But, Waters Casino asserts that this policy is in place to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all of its guests.</p>
<p>The casino has given a few reasons for its age restriction policy. One reason is that the casino wants to ensure that minors are not gambling. Another reason is that the casino wants to create a safe and comfortable environment for adults who are looking to enjoy themselves without having to worry about kids running around.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that if the goal is to keep minors from gambling, then the casino should instead be raising the minimum age to 21 or even 25. But, Waters Casino believes that 18 is a reasonable age as it allows minors who are of legal age to gamble while also ensuring that those who are not of legal age are kept out of the casino.</p>
<p>Waters Casino has stated that it welcomes all guests, regardless of their age, and that it hopes those who are not of legal age will respect the policy.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-puts-18-year-old-age-restriction-in-place"><a href="#Casino-puts-18-year-old-age-restriction-in-place" class="headerlink" title="Casino puts 18-year-old age restriction in place"></a>Casino puts 18-year-old age restriction in place</h1><p>In an effort to keep minors from gambling in the casino, management has decided to enforce an 18-year-old age restriction.</p>
<p>“We want to ensure that only adults are gambling here,” said casino spokesperson Jackie Clark. “This is a place for adults to have fun and relax, and we don’t want anyone under the legal age engaging in that type of behavior.”</p>
<p>The casino is following in the footsteps of other businesses who have also set 18-year-old age restrictions, including alcohol providers and tobacco retailers.</p>
<p>Many people are in support of the new age restriction, saying that it will help keep minors out of the casino.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” said local resident Alice Stevenson. “It’s not right for kids to be gambling their money away when they could be doing something more productive with their time.”</p>
<p>Others, however, feel that the age restriction is unnecessary and will only serve to inconvenience law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why they need to do this,” said local resident John Anderson. “I’m an adult and I should be able to gamble if I want to. This just feels like another way for the government to control our lives.”</p>
