However, for some people, gambling can become a serious problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, between two and six percent of the adult population in the United States meet the criteria for pathological gambling. Pathological gambling is a mental disorder that is characterized by an inability to control one’s impulses to gamble.</p>
<p>If you are one of the few people who struggle with a gambling addiction, don’t worry – you can beat it! The first step is to admit that you have a problem and that you need help. Once you have done that, there are several things that you can do to overcome your addiction:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Seek professional help. This is probably the most important thing that you can do. There are many different types of therapy available for people with a gambling addiction, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), and family therapy. Therapists can help you understand why you gamble and how to resist urges to gamble in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Join a support group. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program that helps people overcome their addiction to gambling. Attending meetings and talking to other members of the group can be helpful in preventing relapse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay away from casinos and online gambling websites. If you are unable to resist the temptation to gamble, it is best to stay away from all forms of gambling altogether. This may be difficult at first, but it is key if you want to overcome your addiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set limits on how much money you can spend on gambling each week/month/year. This will help keep your spending in check and prevent you from going overboard with your gambling habit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a budget and stick to it. Just like with setting limits on your spending for gambling, it is important to create and stick to a budget for all of your expenses – including groceries, utilities, rent, etc. This will help keep your finances in order and prevent you from overspending on unnecessary things like casino games or lottery tickets .</p>
